I worked part-time for artist agents Phosphor Art, building various promos alongside maintaining their existing site.

Designed and developed landing pages for events Phosphor was involved with or attending, like the [AMV Marylebone Road stairwell exhibit](http://phosphorart.com/amv/) and [New Designers](http://phosphorart.com/saa/). I also helped run email campaigns like the 

- [Postcard email](http://www.phosphorart.com/email/postcards/)
- [AMV exhibition](http://phosphorart.com/amv/)
- [New Designers](http://phosphorart.com/saa/)
