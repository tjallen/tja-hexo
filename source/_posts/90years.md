A (highly depressing) React-based visualisation app (unless you're under the age of 18?) Displays the number of weeks in a 90 year human life, along with the number of weeks lived by the user based on their birthdate.

Based on <a title="WaitButWhy's Your Life in Weeks post" href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html">WaitButWhy</a>'s graphs of the number of weeks/days in a 90 year human life. I was interested to see what they'd look like with the actual age of the user on the graph & built the 90years app for this purpose.

Used TDD with Jest & Enzyme to get more familiar with their respective APIs.
