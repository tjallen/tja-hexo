## Hello!
**I'm Thom Allen**, a **freelance front-end developer** working in London. I specialise in creating **responsive, efficient websites & web apps that provide the best possible user experience**. Currently, I'm focusing on developing modern UI components for web apps with libraries like React and Vue.

Over the years I've picked up a variety of skills and experience including: **HTML5 & CSS3, Sass, JavaScript to ES6+, jQuery, Bootstrap, React, Vue, Redux, MobX, Webpack, Gulp**, etc... along with experience in designing sites and layouts, various Content Management Systems and more; though I'm concentrating on front-end development for now. For a more complete list, <a href="/files/Thom_Allen_CV_2016.pdf">see my CV</a>.

**I'm looking for contract work** at a forward-thinking company. Want to work together to improve your business' online presence? Email me using <a href="#contact">the form below</a>.
