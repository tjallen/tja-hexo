## Hello!
**I'm Thom Allen**, a **freelance front-end developer** working in London. I specialise in creating **responsive, efficient websites & web apps that provide the best possible user experience**. Currently, I'm focusing on developing modern UI components for web apps with JavaScript libraries like **React** and **Vue.js**.

I've also got experience in designing sites, Content Management Systems and more; though I'm concentrating on front-end development.
