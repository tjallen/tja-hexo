Spending five days freelancing at [Antidote](http://www.antidote.co.uk/)'s offices, I worked as one of a pair of developers creating banner ads for Travel Republic's summer campaign.

We developed HTML ads with JS animation using the [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap) library and PNG sprite sheets to minimize load and match spec, as well as creating a basic ad viewer for fast review.

With eight formats and a wide variety of destinations to create ads for, we had a mountain of ads to get through, but 186 Git commits later we had triumphed, with only minor repetitive strain injuries...

Sample ad:
<iframe id="ad" src="http://www.thomjamesallen.com/projects/adviewer/ads/GB300x250" scrolling="no" width="300px" height="250px">
  &lt;h2&gt;iframes not supported - try a different browser&lt;/h2&gt;
