I heard the internet cry out. Everyone was desperate for the seven-hundred-trillionth implementation of Conway's Game of Life. 

It's a fairly simple JS + Canvas-based version with a few predefined shapes and the ability to toggle cell state / draw custom shapes. Fairly old & busted at this point, but it was fun to put together so I cherish it like a memory leaking child <3
